# update

This is the [Sequent Microsystems](https://www.sequentmicrosystems.com) Building automation systems board firmware update tool.

## Usage

```bash
~$ git clone https://github.com/SequentMicrosystems/megabas-rpi.git
~$ cd megabas-rpi/update/
~/megabas-rpi/update$ ./update 0
```

For Ubuntu users do the following:
```bash
~$ git clone https://github.com/SequentMicrosystems/megabas-rpi.git
~$ cd megabas-rpi/update/ubuntu/
~/megabas-rpi/update/ubuntu$ ./update 0
```

If you clone the repository already, skip the first step. 
The command will download the newest firmware version from our server and write itÂ  to the board.
The stack level of the board must be provided as a parameter. 
Make sure no one (python scripts or sell scripts or node-red flow) tries to access the card during the update process.
During firmware update we strongly recommend to disconnect all outputs from the board since they can change state unpredictably.
